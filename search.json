The initial posts and videos will cover installing Python, setting up your development environment, understanding Python fundamentals, and introducing data analysis using pandas. These topics are essential for anyone who wants to get started with Python and coding in empirical finance research and will be released throughout January to align with my current teaching.\nCome February, we‚Äôll dive into more advanced topics such as handling dates and timestamp efficiently, diverse file formats for research data, using git and GitHub for collaboration, and techniques to speed up your computations.\nYour input is invaluable! I encourage you to send in your topic suggestions, questions, or any insights you might have. For all blog and channel-related inquiries, please reach out to me at vincent@codes.finance.\nFollow Along! Don‚Äôt miss out on any updates! Subscribe to the newsletter, the blog‚Äôs RSS feed, YouTube channel, and follow me on X. Let‚Äôs raise the bar for empirical finance research together.\nI look forward to sharing this journey with you and seeing where it takes us.\nCheers to a year of coding, discovery, and breakthroughs in empirical finance research!\n- Vincent"
